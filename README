It was an improved version of original bvi editor

How to compile
==============

	gunzip -c bvim-1.3.4.tar.gz | tar xvf -
	cd bvim-1.3.4
	./configure
	make
	make install

MAC OS X
========
Looks like the curses implementation in Darwin is really limited.
You should install and use ncurses instead. You can download it from
ftp.gnu.org; install it and then use
	./configure --with-ncurses=/usr/local/ncurses-5.2
