Directions
===========================

1. Add C-syntax structures parsing and searching (high priority)
2. Add hex-data folding support (or lines, or blocks)
3. Add GZIP, ZIP, TAR, etc signatures to search and highlight
4. Add :unmap (:unm) feature
   -- IN PROGRESS
5. Add :split feature (low priority)
6. Add binary diff mode
7. Templates support (high priority)
8. Add support for 8-bit, 16-bit, 32-bit, 64-bit and 128-bit modes
9. Add support for big-endian and little-endian
10. Add signature search for executable code and file headers
11. VISUAL mode
12. Add tabs for various buffers
13. Add tools tabs (e.g. for templates, history, etc)

Simple tasks
============================

1. Add history of commands
2. Blocks commands:
	a) block-save to separate file
	b) block-reverse
3. Add lua events:
	a) cursor move back, forward, up and down
	b) cursor on some block
4. Add scrolling in tools window (with keys and from lua) (HIGH PRIORITY!)
5. Add checks of terminal color mode
6. Add normal keymapping with keys names
	-- IN PROGRESS
7. Implement block parameter as bitfields (folding, highlighting, color, etc) (LOW PRIORITY)
8. All operations (XOR, AND, etc) must support hexadecimal arguments
9. Prevent blocks overlapping
10. Add folding empty and repeating data sequences
11. Implement "universal" CRC poly/gen calculator, with ability setup generator poly from lua
12. Add C plugins api, with ability for register lua funcs, events, keymaps and :commands
13. Rename project to "bvim"
14. Add lua/plugins hooks into standard handler_* and command_*
15. Add block and symbol annotations - show when place cursor on it

Refactoring Tasks
============================

1. Split out math and logic functions in math.c (and/xor/etc)
2. Implement Core and Editor objects/structures
	-- IN PROGRESS
3. Convert editor output to editor container (for support splitting/diff features)
4. Eliminate DOS stuff
	-- IN PROGRESS
5. Add file stream object for supporting continious and large files
6. Split all output to another file console.c, add unified API for GUI
	-- IN PROGRESS
7. Add doxygen documentation

Not needed to refactor:
 keys.c
 keys.h
 bscript.c
 bscript.h
 blocks.c
 blocks.h
